2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
- Nested For Loops (Both Lasting N Length)
- = O(n) * O(n)
- = **O(n^2)**
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
- One List (With N Length)
- = O(n)
- = **O(n)**
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
- Two Non-Nested Loops (Both Lasting N Length)
- = O(n) + O(n)
- = O(2n) *constant dropped*
- = **O(n)**
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
- Two Lists (Both With N Length)
- = O(n) + O(n)
- = O(2n) *constant dropped*
- = **O(n)**
