Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
    - No Loops
    - Only inserting at specific List index or appending to List
    - Constant Time
    - = **O(1)**
2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
    - No variables added
    - Constant Space
    - = **O(1)**
3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    - Worst Case Is An Empty Buffer
    - One Loop (Lasting N Length)
    - = **O(n)**
4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    - Worst Case Is A Buffer With One Or More Empty Spots
    - New List Created (Lasting N Length)
    - = **O(n)**

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    - Nested For Loops (Both Lasting N Length)
    - = O(n) * O(n)
    - = **O(n^2)**
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    - One List (With N Length)
    - = **O(n)**
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    - Two Non-Nested Loops (Both Lasting N Length)
    - = O(n) + O(n)
    - = O(2n) *constant dropped*
    - = **O(n)**
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    - Two Lists (Both With N Length)
    - = O(n) + O(n)
    - = O(2n) *constant dropped*
    - = **O(n)**
